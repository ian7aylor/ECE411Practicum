# EE411Practicum: Audio Spectrum Vizualizer, Team #2
## Project Overview
Our device will listen to the surounding environment through a microphone, and 
produce a visual display through an array of colorful LED lights. The LEDs are divided
into seven rows to represent the weight of seven predetermined frequencies. 
The device is powered via USB 2.0 and as a sleek design allow the the device to easily 
be portable. This makes it the perfect product for music listeners, as all they have 
to do is:
1. Power the device with a USB 2.0.
2. Play their favorite soundtrack.
3. Enjoy the visual LED display
