List of items seen in the video:
1. The 1st shot shows the ADC values being displayed on the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
These values are coming from the outputs of the three bandpass filters.
2. The next item seen is the bandpass filter circuit. The LEDs light up when the freuency band goes through/
The closer to the center frequency, the brighter the LED gets.
3. The potentiometers change the feedback resistance to the amplifier that goes to the speaker.
4. The oscilloscope is displaying the signal that would go to the NeoPixel matrix. This particular
signal would say "Howdy!" across the LED matrix.
